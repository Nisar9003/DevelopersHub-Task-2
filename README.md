# Project Description: Telco Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

# Objective:
Developed a reusable, production-ready machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company, enabling proactive retention strategies.

# Dataset:
Telco Churn Dataset, containing customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.

# Approach:

Implemented end-to-end data preprocessing using scikit-learn Pipelines and ColumnTransformer (scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features).

Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Evaluated models using F1-score, accuracy, and classification report to select the best-performing pipeline.

Exported the final trained pipeline with joblib for easy reuse and deployment.

# Skills & Concepts Applied:

Machine Learning pipeline construction

Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and encoding

Model selection and hyperparameter tuning

Production-readiness and model deployment practices

Outcome:
Created a fully reusable ML pipeline capable of predicting customer churn on new data, suitable for integration into real-time applications or dashboards for business decision-making.
